**Summary for Improvement: Camera Interaction and Object Recognition**

1. **Enhance Object Recognition**: Improve the accuracy of YOLO detections, especially in cluttered environments. Keep track of detected distances to facilitate better movement planning and orientation for object interactions.

2. **Camera Positioning Adjustments**: Ensure responsive and real-time adjustments of the camera based on detected objects. Maintain a clear protocol for centering on objects within the view, prioritizing those directly engaged or relevant to the userâ€™s requests.

3. **User Interaction**: Continuously tie camera feedback to conversational cues. For instance, if a user expresses a desire to approach an object (e.g., tools or a smartphone), immediately prompt actions that align with that intent.

4. **Spatial Awareness**: Integrate distance readings and visual feedback during movements to avoid obstacles and enhance situational awareness, allowing for smoother interaction engagement.

5. **Contextual Awareness**: Maintain awareness of the environment's layout and the user's activities, adapting responses and movements to facilitate user assistance (e.g., helping Brittany with the power steering pump).

Through these improvements, the robot's interactions will become more seamless and contextually relevant, enhancing overall responsiveness and utility.
