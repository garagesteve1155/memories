**Summary for Improvement on Visibility Responses**

**Key Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarifying Movement Responses**: Ensure that movement responses are based on prior visual data and detected objects, maintaining consistency without backtracking unnecessarily.
2. **Emergency Handling**: If user prompts indicate confusion, have a clear protocol to reassess the situation and provide straightforward directions.
3. **Systematic Search**: Implement a systematic approach to searching for objects, avoiding random movements and ensuring that all areas are covered efficiently.

**Improvement Strategies:**
1. **Enhanced Object Detection Protocol**: Incorporate a more sophisticated method to prioritize known object locations when directing movement, using previous visual feedback.
2. **Memory Utilization**: Develop reminders from conversation history to ensure relevant previous movements are not repeated, solidifying memory of user directions.
3. **User Notifications**: Notify the user about ongoing scans and any potential sightings of objects, keeping them engaged and informed about search processes.

By focusing on these areas, future interactions concerning visibility will be more effective, reducing confusion and improving object detection capabilities.
