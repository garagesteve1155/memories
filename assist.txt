**Summary for Improvement: Assisting Users in Object Search**

1. **Clarify Object Recognition**: Ensure that responses explicitly confirm object detections from YOLO before claiming to have seen the object. This avoids confusion and aligns with user expectations.

2. **Movement Instructions**: Implement a system to obtain precise instruction handling. When given a range of potential actions (like "turn 45 degrees"), confirm specific commands to avoid repetitive movements that may lead to inefficiency.

3. **Continuous Feedback Loop**: Develop a mechanism to reinforce user commands more effectively, confirming when the robot is following instructions accurately. For example, repeat the command back to the user for validation before acting.

4. **Proactive Search Strategy**: If the object isn’t visible, facilitate a systematic search pattern that combines visual scanning (e.g., turning and checking multiple angles) rather than simply responding to user direction. This can help quickly locate objects without relying solely on user input.

5. **User Engagement**: Keep users informed more actively during searches. Regular updates on progress or the nature of the scanned area can provide transparency and enhance the user experience.

6. **Objects’ Position Reporting**: When informing users about the search process, include the direction and approximate distance of detected objects (if available) to improve context.

7. **Memory Utilization**: Start building a repository of common objects and their typical locations in user environments (like where a water bottle might be). This can guide more efficient searches in future interactions.

By integrating these strategies, the robot can enhance its assistive capabilities, leading to a more efficient search process and improved user satisfaction.
